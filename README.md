## Description

CoolTShirts sells shirts of all kinds, as long as they are T-shaped and cool. Recently, CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases. Using touch attribution, they’d like to map their customers’ journey: from initial visit to purchase. They can use that information to optimize their marketing campaigns. This project will guide you through some of that process.

In this project we're going to take a look at some of the following key concepts: using aggregation functions, using the DISTINCT keyword and using the JOIN keyword.

You will see the Database Schema below, as well as the code output in the uploaded project files.
