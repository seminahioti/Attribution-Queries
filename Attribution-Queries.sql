-- Step 3: What is the user journey? How many FIRST touches is each campaign responsible for? Youâ€™ll need to use a first-touch query. Group by campaign and count the number of first touches for each.
-- We're taking that first touch query that we wrote in the first part of this.

    SELECT user_id,
        MAX(timestamp) as last_touch_at -- we're changing the min to max from step 3 because now we want the last timestamp

-- Step 6: How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for? This query will look similar to your last-touch query, but with an additional WHERE clause.
